  <h2>About the movie</h2>
  <p>Sinners is a 2025 American period supernatural horror film written, produced, and directed by Ryan Coogler. Set in the 1930s in the Southern United States, the film stars Michael B. Jordan in a dual role as twin brothers who return to their hometown but are faced with a greater evil.</p>
  <p>Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.</p>
  <p> Coogler began developing the genre film through his production company Proximity Media by January 2024, when Jordan was cast. Warner Bros. Pictures acquired distribution rights the next month following a bidding war, and casting for additional roles took place in April, ahead of the start of filming that month. Filming wrapped in July 2024.</p>
